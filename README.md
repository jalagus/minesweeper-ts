minesweeper-ts
==============

Basic minesweeper in TypeScript using HTML5 canvas for graphics.

In order to run the game, if the `logic.js` file is not present (or you have modified the source code) first compile the .ts file

```tsc logic.ts```

and then simply open the `index.html` in any browser that supports javascript.
